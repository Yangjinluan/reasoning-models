# Reasoning

Experiments with reasoning models, training techniques, papers

## TODOs

TODO: organize and link correctly

- o1 replication efforts (check stuff that is just distillation from o1 itself vs training)
- reasoning tokens stuff
- Coconut META AI December 2024
- tools: pyvene and other model-internals-explorers
- reinforcement learning as applied to reasoning models
